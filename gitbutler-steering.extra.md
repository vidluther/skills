### Create stacked pull requests

- If this session depends on another in-flight branch, stack its branch on top of that dependency instead of mixing the changes.
- If this session is working in a stack, put commits on the branch where they belong.
- Ask before moving commits onto lower, pushed, reviewed, or shared branches.
- Use `but move` for branch stacking and restacking. Do not recreate branches to simulate stacking.
- For stacked branches, create pull requests with `but pr`, not `gh`, so GitButler keeps the right PR base branches and stack metadata.

### Update from the target branch automatically

- When GitButler status shows new changes on the target branch and the workspace holds only this session's branches, update with `but pull` directly — its output reports the result and `but undo` reverts it.
- If an update you started on your own initiative reports conflicted commits, stop and ask before resolving them (`but undo` reverts the pull if the user prefers).
- When other agents' branches are applied, run `but pull --check` first and ask before updating if it reports conflicts or their branches would move.
- If the user asks you to handle update conflicts, use GitButler's conflict tools. Ask before resolving semantic conflicts, dependency updates, generated files, or conflicts involving another person's work.

### Open draft pull requests by default

- When asked to open a pull request, create it as a draft with GitButler unless the user says it is ready for review.
- Remember that creating a draft pull request still publishes the branch.

### Commit message convention

- Follow the `type(scope): summary` commit-message convention when writing commit messages.
